# DDT(Data-Driven Testing) is alive!  
## What is it? 
 In this solution I want to provide sample how to use external files, to provide highest code quality, by preparing thousands of unit tests in one simple [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/), or [NUnit](http://nunit.org/) test
That's my tutorial how I prepared my module to go life on production with minimal number of bugs only by creating one simple, easy and readable unit test. 
That's just my extension to XUnit and NUnit to provide more and better (yeah I know, how it looks like, but I'm not vegan, hipster with lumberjack beard).

## What do I get?  
Nothing special just an idea, how to minimalize stress and hot fixes after relase.

## How is it done?  
I created simple Data Source Providers to read from excel spreedshit (CSV and DB providers are during implementation)
